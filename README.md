# RPG
Web apps I wrote in Python, mostly for homebrew Call of Cthulhu combat.

I cobbled together a bunch of random generators and automated combat resolution stuff in Google Sheets and I wanted to strengthen my Python web skills. This group of pages represents a super no-frills port of those spreadsheets so that my players could easily interact with them during games.

It's all pretty dirty -- no input sanitization or output encoding is in use, as this is mostly to help me learn more Python skills. At some point it'll be fun to turn this into a proper webapp but that day is not today.
